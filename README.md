## About Me :floppy_disk:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi! I'm Ryuji &mdash; a programmer who grew up with C. The third generation of the coding family. I lived through my teenage years with BCC Developer and HTML code edited with Notepad in Windows.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Intel 8085 Assembly to Python, I explore both the *Past* and the *Future* of computing.

## Current Focus :wrench:

- Building reusable AI models with clear logic and structure
- Exploring the connection between ‚Äúvibe coding‚Äù and traditional ‚Äúlegacy code‚Äù
- Creating some personal tools

## My Philosophy :mage_man:

- Coding is not just work; it is a creation and an art.
- I code like bleath, debug like walk.
